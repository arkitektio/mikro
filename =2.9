Using version ^2.10.0 for zarr

  SolverProblemError

  The current project's Python requirement (>=3.6,<4.0) is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:
    - zarr requires Python >=3.7, <4, so it will not be satisfied for Python >=3.6,<3.7
  
  Because zarr (2.10.0) requires Python >=3.7, <4
   and no versions of zarr match >2.10.0,<3.0.0, zarr is forbidden.
  So, because mikro depends on zarr (^2.10.0), version solving failed.

  • Check your dependencies Python requirement: The Python requirement can be specified via the `python` or `markers` properties
    
    For zarr, a possible solution would be to set the `python` property to ">=3.7,<4.0"
